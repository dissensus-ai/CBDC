# What Does Identity-Linked Information Buy?

**Current review candidate: 12 September 2026.** This branch contains a new compact measurement manuscript and a code-level correction. Start with [the draft](revision-2026-09-12/manuscript/main.tex), [PDF](revision-2026-09-12/manuscript/main.pdf), [scientific adjudication](revision-2026-09-12/ADJUDICATION.md), and [reproduction instructions](revision-2026-09-12/REPRODUCE.md).

The full 52-replicate independent-population analysis has been freshly reproduced with identical raw records. Its historical H2 confirmatory label was erroneous: the driver opened the non-inferiority gate despite an unset tolerance. This branch repairs that logic and reports H2 descriptively. The August raw files are retained unchanged as historical evidence; consult the adjudicated September results for interpretation.

The 122 original ladder units are reaggregated, the surface's 5% versus planned 3% prevalence deviation is disclosed, and missing per-world permutation controls are supplied as retrospective diagnostics. The new manuscript distinguishes customer attributes, watchlists, and oracle linkage; no system deployment or anonymity guarantee is claimed.

**Status:** draft for review; no journal submission, arXiv submission, revised Zenodo deposit, or co-author endorsement is implied. The root `main.tex`/`main.pdf` and the old documentation below are August historical artifacts, not this branch's September manuscript. Build from `revision-2026-09-12/manuscript/` only. All new datasets are synthetic.

## Abstract

This paper challenges the assumption that comprehensive transaction surveillance is necessary for CBDC financial stability and crime prevention. It proposes an alternative architecture built on anonymized pattern detection, transaction-level intervention, and opt-in deanonymization, and argues that the surveillance–privacy trade-off is weaker than CBDC design documents assume.

## Status (August 2026)

`main.tex` on this branch is now the **corrected** manuscript. The February version
it replaces reported §4.5 "validation" at AUC = 1.000 with watchlist access adding
zero marginal value. That was a data-generating artifact — launderers were *defined*
to hold 3–6 wallets against 1–2, so `num_wallets` separated the classes by
construction, and a saturated denominator made both the "87–95% of surveillance-based
effectiveness" figure and the "zero marginal improvement" result arithmetically
forced rather than measured. **Neither claim is supported and neither should be
cited.** `detection/` is the honest replacement harness.

What replaced them, on 8,000 entities and 388 illicit: the marginal value of
identity-linked auxiliary information is **model- and metric-dependent**. Average
precision moves +0.0044 for the boosted model (90% CI [−0.0008, +0.0102]) and
**+0.0625** for the linear one (CI [+0.0478, +0.0781]), which the equivalence test
reads as surveillance-superior. Withholding identity is not free; what it costs
depends on the detector.

Also corrected: the degeneracy audit is **pre-specified**, not "pre-registered" (no
public timestamped registration exists); H.R. 1919 is described as having passed the
House per Congress.gov, not as enacted legislation.

The 21 July positioning pass stands — the §2.4 gap claim was falsified against a
30-year cryptographic-compliance lineage (trustee e-cash → Compact E-Cash → GGM16 →
Platypus/PEReDi → Privacy Pools) plus BIS Aurora/Hertha, and the paper repositioned
around what survives. Item-by-item log in `CHANGES-FOR-ANDREW.md`, bibliography
rationale in `FORWARD_NOTE.md`, both on `jul2026-working`.

Target venue: *Frontiers in Blockchain*, Research Topic on institutional DLT.

```

## `detection/` — Section 4.5 validation pipeline

Self-contained, seeded, and gated. Four evidence tiers (T1 structure-only on unlinked
pseudonyms → T2 + pseudonymous linkage → T3 + identity attributes → T4 + watchlist), with
entity-disjoint cross-validation, entity-clustered bootstrap CIs, a label-permutation
negative control, and a TOST equivalence test for the T2 vs T4 contrast.

A **pre-specified degeneracy audit** runs before any headline number and hard-fails if any
single feature reaches entity-level AUC > 0.95. Run it against the original DGP and it fails
on `num_wallets` at 1.000; on the shipped DGP the worst feature sits ≈ 0.84–0.92.

```bash
cd detection/
python3 run_all.py                  # seed 20260707, 8000 entities, δ = 0.03
python3 run_all.py --seed 42        # every number regenerates from the one seed
python3 test_pipeline.py            # regression tests
```

`detection/confirmatory/` holds the prospective pipeline for the operational
endpoint — missed illicit entities at a fixed alert budget, on independently
generated train and test populations — with the freeze enforced in code. See
its README; note that the alert budget originally proposed sits in a saturated
regime where the test cannot fail, which is why it was not adopted.

Requires Python 3.11+ with `numpy`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas` (developed on 3.14 /
numpy 2.3.5 / scipy 1.16.3 / sklearn 1.8.0 / pandas 2.3.3). The committed `results/` were
regenerated byte-identically on a clean checkout — if your run differs, the environment
differs, and that's worth knowing before we quote anything.

Reference numbers, real-data adapters (AMLworld, Elliptic) and the honest read of what these
synthetic results do and do not license: `detection/README.md`.

## `pet_aml_sim.py` — Section 5.4 PET-AML stack

PSI watchlist screening, ZK policy proof generation/verification, secure MPC risk
propagation, queueing delays. Pure Python 3, no dependencies.

```bash
python3 pet_aml_sim.py --days 2 --tx-per-day 20000 --psps 8 --seed 7
```

**Note:** the copy of `pet_aml_sim.py` on this branch (`main`) still has the escalation-ordering
bug described below — it has been fixed, but only on `jul2026-working`, alongside the
manuscript update that depends on it. Use that branch if you want the corrected simulator; this
one is kept as-is because `main.tex` here (the stale February version) still quotes the old
"zero escalations" result, and updating the code without updating the text would make the two
contradict each other on the same branch.

```bash
git checkout jul2026-working   # corrected pet_aml_sim.py + matching manuscript
```

**Original issue, for reference:** `risk_tier` was read inside the transaction loop (travel-rule
check and escalation, ~lines 468/475) but only assigned by `run_batch` risk propagation *after*
the loop completed — so tier-based escalation could never fire, and the "zero escalations"
result was guaranteed by construction rather than by the architecture. Fixed on
`jul2026-working` by running risk propagation once per simulated day instead of once at the end;
a reseeded rerun there now reports a real (small) escalation count.

## References

`references.bib` was corrected in July 2026. Five entries in the February version carried
fabricated author sets (`OfflineCBDC2024`, `ZKPSurvey2025`, `UFLaw2024`, `OxfordCBDCSurvey2025`,
`Koti2024Graphiti`); all are now verified against Crossref / IACR ePrint / publisher records,
along with fixes to `Campanelli2019` (was `Campanelli2017`), `Wang2025UnbalancedPSI`,
`choi2025cbdcprivacy`, and the `ECBConsultation2021` note. Eight entries were appended for the
positioning pass. Rationale per entry: `FORWARD_NOTE.md` on `jul2026-working`.

## Building the paper

Plain `article` class, no local `.cls` and no external graphics — `main.tex` and
`references.bib` are all you need.

```bash
pdflatex main && bibtex main && pdflatex main && pdflatex main
```
