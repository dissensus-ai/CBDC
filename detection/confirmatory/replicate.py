"""One confirmatory replicate: independent train and test populations.

Protocol v3 section 4.1. This is the piece that replaces the out-of-fold
cross-validation path in `detection_experiment.py`, which section 4.2 forbids
for confirmatory claims: concatenated OOF rankings mix fold structure into a
single list and understate the shift between independently generated
populations, which is the shift a deployed detector actually faces.

Each replicate draws TWO worlds from disjoint RNG streams, fits every
model x tier on the training world only, and scores the test world once.
Nothing is refit, retuned, or reselected using test data.

Failures are logged and counted, never silently redrawn (section 6.3). A seed
whose audit fails is a failed replicate, not a seed to be replaced -- replacing
it would condition the analysis set on the generator behaving, which biases
toward worlds where the gate happens to pass.
