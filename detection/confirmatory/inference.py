"""Replicate-level inference: non-inferiority, gatekeeping, pilot sizing.

Implements the statistical erratum to protocol v3 (E1-E4).

Three things here differ from the pilot pipeline and each was a correction:

E1  The decision is ONE-SIDED non-inferiority, not two-sided equivalence.
    "U <= delta" establishes only that T2 is not unacceptably worse than T4.
    Calling that "equivalent" claims the two-sided result, which was never
    tested. The word matters in the manuscript and so it matters here.

E2  H2 is GATED on H1. Testing H2 after H1 returns any verdict -- including
    inconclusive -- is sequential reporting with no multiplicity protection.

E3  The interval is a Student-t CI for the MEAN of the replicate estimates.
    Raw percentiles of {delta_r} describe between-world dispersion and are not
    a confidence interval for the mean; reporting them as one understates
    uncertainty about the quantity actually being claimed.
